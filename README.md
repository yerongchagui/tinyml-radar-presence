This work compares various machine learning model compression techniques in terms of compression ratio and accuracy loss. Data compression techniques such as quantisation, pruning, and clustering are explored.

Contents of repository:
* `/model_compression` is where you will find the compressed model source files.
* `/embed_deploy` contains the source code for the embedded implementation.
